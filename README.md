# Mi Band
Sweet and simple Android implementation to control some aspects of your Xiaomi Mi Band.

* Connect and Disconnect
* Start vibration (with pre defined and customs values)
* Change led's colors (with pre defined and customs values)
* Get battery info
* Sync with your Mi Band (steps, slept hours, etc)
* Real time step counter

## Usage
Mi-Band is ultra simple to use! just follow this 1 step:

0. In your app's dependencies add the library:
```java
dependencies {
    compile 'com.betomaluje.miband:app:1.0.4'
}
```
that's it! You're ready!

Note: this is thanks to the new Android Studio that uses jCenter instead of MavenCentral. To see this, you can open your main `build.gradle` file, and under the repositories you should see `jcenter()`. If not, add this as a repository
```java
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url 'https://dl.bintray.com/betomaluje/maven/'
        }
    }
}
```
Now, to start testing you can use this library in [activities, fragments](https://github.com/betomaluje/Mi-Band/blob/master/MiBandExample/app/src/main/java/com/betomaluje/android/miband/example/activities/MainNormalActivity.java) an even [services](https://github.com/betomaluje/Mi-Band/blob/master/MiBandExample/app/src/main/java/com/betomaluje/android/miband/example/activities/MainServiceActivity.java)!
As an alternative you can use the pre defined [MiBandService](https://github.com/betomaluje/Mi-Band/wiki/MiBandService)

1. Define your Mi Band variable (globaly or localy, it doesn't matter because it's a Singleton) and pass it the current Context variable:
```java
        MiBand miBand = MiBand.getInstance(MyActivity.this);
```
2. Now, to toggle connection you can use
```java
if (!miBand.isConnected()) {
    miBand.connect(new ActionCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Object data) {
            Log.d(TAG, "Connected with Mi Band!");
            //show SnackBar/Toast or something
        }

        @Override
        public void onFail(int errorCode, String msg) {
            Log.d(TAG, "Connection failed: " + msg);
        }
    });
} else {
    miBand.disconnect();
}
```
## Actions
Now the fun part: sending commands to your band.

### Vibration
For vibration you can use the following methods:
```java
//to vibrate using the default band color
miBand.startVibration(VibrationMode.VIBRATION_WITH_LED);

//to vibrate until you manually stop it
miBand.startVibration(VibrationMode.VIBRATION_UNTIL_CALL_STOP);

//to vibrate without the led
miBand.startVibration(VibrationMode.VIBRATION_WITHOUT_LED);

//to stop vibration
miBand.stopVibration();
```
Also there's a custom vibration method
```java
miBand.customVibration(times, on_time, off_time);
```        
where `times` is an int value to determine **how many times** will vibrate(I recommend to use between 1-3 times only)
and `on_time` is the time in milliseconds that each vibration will be **On** (not more than 500 milliseconds)
and `off_time` is the **pause** between each consecutive vibration
        
### LED Color
To change the LED color, you can use
```java
miBand.setLedColor(color);
```
where `color` is an int value representing the color you want

For convenience, there's a `ColorPickerDialog` class to help choose the int value of a color
```java
new ColorPickerDialog(MyActivity.this, 255, new ColorPickerDialog.OnColorSelectedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onColorSelected(int rgb) {
        Log.i(TAG, "selected color: " + rgb);
        miBand.setLedColor(rgb);
    }
}).show();
```
or you can use 
```java
miBand.setLedColor(flash_time, color, pause_time);
```
where `flash_time` is an int value to determine **how many times** will the led flash (I recommend using 1-3 values only)
and `color` is the int **value of the color**
and `pause_time` is the **pause** in milliseconds between each flash

### Battery Info
To get the battery information just use
```java
miBand.getBatteryInfo(new ActionCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(final Object data) {
        BatteryInfo battery = (BatteryInfo) data;
        //get the cycle count, the level and other information
        Log.e(TAG, "Battery: " + battery.toString());
    }

    @Override
    public void onFail(int errorCode, String msg) {
        Log.e(TAG, "Fail battery: " + msg);
    }
});
```
### Syncronization
To sync data with yor Mi Band use
```java
miBand.startListeningSync();
```
this will start the sync process. Also you can 
```java
if (miBand.isSyncNotification())
    miBand.stopListeningSync();
```
After you are finished syncing with the band, you can access the information using
```java
Calendar before = Calendar.getInstance();
//7 days before
before.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, -7);
long temp = before.getTimeInMillis() / 1000;
before.setTimeInMillis(temp);

Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();
//now
today.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000);

//use DateUtils to display the time in the format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
Log.i(TAG, "data from " + DateUtils.convertString(before) + " to " + DateUtils.convertString(today));

//all our data is stored in ActivitySQLite as ActivityData objects
ArrayList<ActivityData> allActivities = ActivitySQLite.getInstance(ActivitiesChartActivity.this)
        .getActivitySamples((int) before.getTimeInMillis(), (int) today.getTimeInMillis());
```
to get the sleeping data use
```java
ActivitySQLite.getInstance(MySleepActivity.this).getSleepSamples(int timestamp_from, int timestamp_to)
```
and to get the activity data use
  ```java
ActivitySQLite.getInstance(MyActivitiesActivity.this).getActivitySamples(int timestamp_from, int timestamp_to)
```
to get ALL the data use
```java
ActivitySQLite.getInstance(MyAllActivity.this).getAllActivitiesSamples(int timestamp_from, int timestamp_to)
```
#### Activities example
```java
Calendar before = Calendar.getInstance();
//7 days before
before.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, -7);
long temp = before.getTimeInMillis() / 1000;
before.setTimeInMillis(temp);

Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();
//now
today.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000);

//use DateUtils to display the time in the format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
Log.i(TAG, "data from " + DateUtils.convertString(before) + " to " + DateUtils.convertString(today));

//all our data is stored in ActivitySQLite as ActivityData objects
ArrayList<ActivityData> allActivities = ActivitySQLite.getInstance(ActivitiesChartActivity.this)
        .getActivitySamples((int) before.getTimeInMillis(), (int) today.getTimeInMillis());
        
float movement_divisor = 180.0f;

float value;

String dateString = "";
for (ActivityData ad : allActivities) {

    Calendar date = Calendar.getInstance();
    date.setTimeInMillis(ad.getTimestamp() * 1000L);

    dateString = DateUtils.convertString(date);

    Log.i(TAG, "date " + dateString);
    Log.i(TAG, "steps " + ad.getSteps());

    short movement = ad.getIntensity();

    byte steps = ad.getSteps();
    if (steps != 0) {
        // I'm not sure using steps for this is actually a good idea
        movement = steps;
    }
    
    //the value
    value = ((float) movement) / movement_divisor;
}
```
#### Sleeping example
```java
Calendar before = Calendar.getInstance();
//7 days before
before.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, -7);
long temp = before.getTimeInMillis() / 1000;
before.setTimeInMillis(temp);

Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();
//now
today.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000);

//use DateUtils to display the time in the format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
Log.i(TAG, "data from " + DateUtils.convertString(before) + " to " + DateUtils.convertString(today));

ArrayList<ActivityData> allActivities = ActivitySQLite.getInstance(SleepChartActivity.this)
        .getSleepSamples((int) before.getTimeInMillis(), (int) today.getTimeInMillis());

float movement_divisor = 180.0f;

float value;

String dateString = "";
for (ActivityData ad : allActivities) {

    Calendar date = Calendar.getInstance();
    date.setTimeInMillis(ad.getTimestamp() * 1000L);

    dateString = DateUtils.convertString(date);

    Log.i(TAG, "date " + dateString);
    Log.i(TAG, "steps " + ad.getSteps());

    value = ((float) ad.getIntensity()) / movement_divisor;

    switch (ad.getType()) {
        case ActivityData.TYPE_DEEP_SLEEP:
            //DEEP SLEEP TYPE. Only here we need to adjust the value
            value += ActivityData.Y_VALUE_DEEP_SLEEP;
            doSomethingWithDeepSleep(value);
            break;
        case ActivityData.TYPE_LIGHT_SLEEP:
            //LIGHT SLEEP TYPE
            doSomethingWithLightSleep(value);
            break;
        default:
            //UNKNOWN TYPE
            doSomethingWithUnknownSleep(value);
            break;
    }
}
```
Also you can track the "Sleep comparison"
```java
private void refreshSleepAmounts(List<ActivityData> samples) {
    ActivityAnalysis analysis = new ActivityAnalysis();
    ActivityAmounts amounts = analysis.calculateActivityAmounts(samples);
    
    float hoursOfSleep = amounts.getTotalSeconds() / (float) (60 * 60);
    
        Log.i(TAG, "hoursOfSleep " + hoursOfSleep + " h");
    
    for (ActivityAmount amount : amounts.getAmounts()) {
        Log.i(TAG, "name " + amount.getName());
        Log.i(TAG, "total seconds " + amount.getTotalSeconds());
        Log.i(TAG, "kind " + amount.getActivityKind());
    }
}
```
## Known issues
### First time connection
The first time you connect with your Mi Band please be patient. It takes around 45 seconds. After this time, if you can't connect to it, try the following

1. Try disconnecting and again connecting to Bluetooth
2. Uninstall and install again your app

### Mi Fit app incompatibility
If you also have the Mi Fit app installed, you may lose some information on the syncing because Mi Fit and your app will be "fighting" to sync the Mi Band data. Once the Mi Band data is synced, it will be "deleted" from the band and lost forever. 

Also the pairing process may ocurr several times each time you switch from apps because you will lose th pairing info from each app.

Nevertheless you can still send commands to the Mi Band if you are using both apps. It's not mandatory to uninstall Mi Fit to use this library.
